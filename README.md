## üìÇ Projects Description

### ‚òû Efficient Estimation in Semiparametric Accelerated Life Models for Recurrent Events

Accelerated life models, such as the Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model, relate covariates to log event times under right-censoring and extend naturally to recurrent events via the Accelerated Gap Time (AGT) model. While they provide intuitive interpretations and serve as meaningful alternatives to the Cox model, they often overlook the effects of interventions occurring between events‚Äîcommon in fields like reliability engineering and biomedical research.

- Proposed a broader class of **semiparametric accelerated life models** incorporating an **effective age process** to capture intervention effects.
- Developed a **sample-based weighted efficient score function** using parametric submodels to address infinite-dimensional baseline hazards and non-monotone score functions.
- Estimators are **consistent and asymptotically normal**.
- Validated via simulations and application to real biomedical data.

### ‚òû Deep Learning Methods in Survival Analysis for Recurrent Events: A Review

Recurrent event data extend traditional survival analysis beyond the first event, capturing repeated occurrences across healthcare, engineering, and social sciences. This review focuses on **deep learning methods** specifically designed for recurrent event survival analysis.

- Provide a **theoretical foundation** for modeling recurrent events using deep learning techniques.  
- Survey **state-of-the-art deep survival methods**, including RNNs, LSTMs, attention mechanisms, and deep hazard/intensity estimators.  
- Discuss key challenges such as **censoring**, **time-varying covariates**, and **irregular event sequences** in recurrent event data.  
- Highlight **practical applications** in hospital readmissions, chronic disease progression, system reliability, and behavioral event modeling.  
- Demonstrate how deep survival learning improves **predictive performance** and **interpretability** compared to traditional recurrent event models.

### ‚òû Modeling Recurrent Events with DNNs in Accelerated Failure Time Models Using Gehan Loss

Recurrent event data commonly arise in biomedical and reliability studies, with multiple failures per subject.

- Extend **DeepR-AFT** framework to recurrent events via **DeepR-AGT-Recur**, a DNN model with **Gehan-type rank loss**.
- Capture nonlinear relationships between covariates and event times over multiple occurrences.
- Include a **subject-level frailty term** for within-subject dependence.
- Employ **stratified subsampling** for stable learning amid censored and irregularly spaced events.
- Perform simulation studies and real-world data applications to show that DeepR-AGT-Recur outperforms traditional AFT and Cox models in accuracy and interpretability.

### ‚òû Efficient Semiparametric Methods for Generalized Virtual Age Models with Time-Varying Covariates

Traditional virtual age models assume covariates influence only baseline hazard of initial failure times, ignoring their effect on the virtual age reflecting post-intervention condition.

- Introduce a **general class of virtual age models** where **time-varying covariates directly influence virtual age**.
- Offers flexible modeling of recurrent events (e.g., post-surgical readmissions), accounting for censoring and imperfect interventions.
- Inference based on **semiparametric efficiency theory** via reparameterization of baseline intensity and monotone estimating equations.
- Estimators are **consistent and asymptotically normal**.
- Proposed a **novel failure time simulation algorithm**.
- Demonstrated improved accuracy on biomedical datasets.


### ‚òû LSTM-Based Accelerated Failure Time Models for Recurrent Event Risk Prediction  

Recurrent event data arise in many domains such as biomedical research, reliability engineering, and risk assessment, where individuals or systems may experience multiple events over time. Traditional Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) models offer interpretability but struggle with capturing nonlinear temporal dynamics and time-varying covariates.  

- Proposed an **LSTM-AFT framework** that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with AFT models.  
- Captures **static and dynamic covariates** as well as **nonlinear dependencies** across event histories.  
- Provides a flexible approach for **risk prediction** in recurrent event settings.  
- Demonstrated improved **predictive accuracy** compared to standard recurrent event models.

### ‚òû Extending Hybrid Neural Networks for Predictive Modeling of Incurred but Not Reported Claims Reserves  

Claims reserving in insurance requires accurate prediction of both Reported But Not Settled (RBNS) and Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) claims. While recent hybrid neural network approaches have advanced RBNS modeling, IBNR claims pose unique challenges due to the absence of detailed claim-level features and the presence of large-loss risks.  

- Extended **hybrid neural network models** to explicitly handle IBNR reserves.  
- Investigated the use of **predictive indicators** and **ensemble techniques** to improve accuracy.  
- Proposed a **dual-framework** separating RBNS and IBNR modeling for improved reserve allocation.  
- Results show potential for **enhanced prediction** and **nuanced treatment of large-loss claims** in actuarial practice.
